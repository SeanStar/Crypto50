<h1>How to Deposit</h1>
<p>Crypto50 allows you to deposit 4 different crypto-currencies. These currencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, 
and Feathercoin. If you are new to crypto-currencies, I suggest you take a look at bitcoin first. The bitcoin 
official website provides more than enough information for you to get started.<br>
It can be found at <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">http://www.bitcoin.org/</a>.<br>
<br>
If you already know about bitcoin and how it works, but don't know about these other crypto-currencies, you can take a look 
at their websites:<br>
<a href="http://www.litecoin.org/">http://www.litecoin.org/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.namecoin.org/">http://www.namecoin.org/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.feathercoin.com/">http://www.feathercoin.com/</a><br>
<br>
After you have a good idea of how crypto-currencies work, all that is needed to play at Crypto50 is the coins themselves. <br>
<br>
A popular exchange for purchasing the crypto-currencies we support is <a href="http://www.btc-e.com/">http://www.btc-e.com/</a>.<br>
<br>
You can then deposit using the addresses given for each currency, your balance will reflect the deposit automatically. You may 
gamble with 0 confirmations, but you can only withdraw after the deposit is completed (with the listed confirmations).</p>
