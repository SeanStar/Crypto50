<h1>Provably Fair System</h1>
<p>Crypto50 offers the unique ability to verify that your roll was not manipulated in any way immediately. 
Prior to hitting the "Roll" button, the user is given the choice to modify the roll parameters. The user may 
modify whether or not they roll over or under a target roll value (which determines their return multiplier 
and potential profit). Knowing this, Crypto50 pre-rolls a roll value which is then encrypted and can be
be instantly decrypted into plain text afterwards using the encrypted roll value key. The decrypted plain 
text will match the plain text roll value given after the roll to determine the bets outcome. Therefore, 
you can prove that the roll value was generated before you clicked the "Roll" button, preventing us 
from manipulating your bet after-the-fact.</p>
<h4>How to verify a bet:</h4>
<p>Bet Encrypted Roll Values are encrypted with RIJNDAEL_128 using a 32 character (256-bit) key and randomly 
generated 16 character (128-bit) IV. The Encrypted Roll Value or ciphertext is the hex representation 
of the IV appended to the front of the encrypted string. The Encrypted Roll Value's Key is also converted to hex.<br>
<br>
Steps to verify bet:<br>
1. Click "Provably Fair Code" link and copy 64 character hexidecimal ciphercode to a notepad.<br>
2. Change roll parameters to whatever you want and click "Roll" button.<br>
3. Click "Transactions" link in the navigation bar.<br>
4. Find the bet that you just made (should be at the very top), click the bet id number link for more information.<br>
5. Verify that the Encrypted Roll Value is the same as you have copied.<br>
6. Decrypt Encrypted Roll Value with the provided key in the information window<br>
7. Decrypted value should match the bet roll.<br>
<br>
To decrypt the roll value, you must convert the hexadecimal strings back into binary and then use a decrypt 
function with the key, iv, and encrypted string to get the resulting plain text.<br>
<br>
Example php code you can also use to decrypt bets:</p>
<pre style="font-size:14px;">
&lt;?php
$ERV_key = ""; //Key to encrypted roll value
$ERV = ""; //Encrypted roll value 

$key = pack("H*",$ERV_key);
$iv = pack("H*",substr($ERV, 0, 32));
$data = pack("H*",substr($ERV, 32));

$decrypt = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);
echo $decrypt;
?&gt;
</pre>
